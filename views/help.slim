| The input file should be a tab-delimited text file containing chromosome names and locations. Allowed formats include BED, GFF, and ENCODE narrowPeak or broadPeak, or any file with the same columns of information. Chromosome names should be located in the first column, in the format "chr1", "chr2", etc.

| For BED and ENCODE files, start and end locations are in columns 2 and 3, respectively. For GFF files, start and end locations are in columns 4 and 5.

h3 How are the peak widths and intensities used? 
p
p
| If the "use peak widths" option is selected, each region will be weighted by its width, so that wide regions are weighted more heavily than small regions. 
p
| If a column of intensity/score values is selected, each region will be weighted by its intensity, so that regions of high intensity are weighted more heavily than those of lesser intensity. For BED and ENCODE files, intensity values are usually located in column 5. For GFF files, intensity values are usually located in column 6.

p
| If neither option is selected, each region in the input file will be weighted equally in the graph.
